# personalProjects

This is all my personal projects made in a variety of languages.

# Java

### Project Euler Submissions
This folder contains many of my submissions to Project Euler. Project Euler is a website that contains hundreds of math problems that cannot be solved with hands, and must be solved with an algorithm due to the size of the numbers/computations used in the problem. I have a lot of fun doing these, because I am very interested in mathematics and competitive math. My solutions are written in Java because I am very comfortable with solving problems in this language.

### USACO Submissions
This folder has all my USACO practice problems that I did. I am new to USACO and started in early December/late November. However I am pretty interested in this and did quite a bit of problems, and although these are mostly bronze difficulty problems I hope they are able to show my competency in Java.

### Advent of Code Submissions
This folder has the first 5 days of Advent of Code. Advent of Code is a series of challenges posted in the month of December that have you complete questions with algorithms. I only did the first 5 days of this, and then school and finals started picking up so I didn't have the most time to work on these problems.

# Python

### Homework Helper
This was probably the most extensive project I have worked on to date. This project is essentially a pomodoro timer that tracked if you doing work or not. If it sensed that your computer was inactive after a certain amount of time, it would conclude that you were slacking off and not doing work and it would enact a certain consequence. I also added a basic facial recognition feature that tracked if you weren't looking at your screen (in other words probably looking down at a phone or some other distraction). I used tkinter again for the gui and the virtual timer. I also used OpenCV for the camera/facial recognition aspect.

### Math Trainer
Our school's math team has come a long way, and to make sure that we can reach our fullest potential and suceed at competitons, I created a program that logs/categorizes all the mistakes we make at competitions. Through this, we can learn from our old mistakes and also recycle problems that we got wrong in the past, so that we avoid making the same mistakes again and set ourselves up for sucess. This is still a major work in progress, and not all of the code is committed publically yet so I can test for bugs.

### Auto Zoom 
Auto Zoom was one of my favorite projects. Back during the pandemic era, I struggled to wake up for my zoom classes, so what I did was make a program to join my zoom classes for me so I wouldn't have to wake up, rather I could run the program the night before. This was very ideal and the highlight of this project was the extensive use of python's automation library pyautogui.

### Science Assessment 
Science Assessment was a program I made a few years prior for a science project that talked about the earth and tectonic plates. The main highlight of this project is the use of python's optimized gui library tkinter. 

### Alarm Clock 
Alarm Clock was a simple program I made to play youtube videos as alarm clocks to wake up. This was because I had to buy custom ringtones on my phone to get the alarms I wanted, so I made a very basic progam to overcome that problem.

### Discord Bots
These were many discord bots I coded a long time ago and recently uploaded to github with my friends so that we could have fun in our server and mess around.

### Project Rosalind Submissions
This folder contains some submissions to Project Rosalind. Project Rosalind is similar to Project Euler, but instead of math problems they are biology/more science based problems. I am more comfortable writing these in python because of how easy it is to mutate and modify strings in python. These are also fun to me, but I have more fun doing Project Euler questions. Most of these questions that I did are more simulation based rather than utilzing clever shortcuts to optimize programs.


# C++

### 8995V
This folder has all the code that I've written for my VEX Robotics Team in the 2022-2023 season. Although this repository contains personal projects, I am including this because I was the sole programmer of my team last year and thus all the code in this folder is written by me. Some highlights of the work that I've included here is the use of movement algorithms such as PID, and also more work with GUI's on our robot's brain. This contains the bulk of my C++ knowledge. Something to note is that I do not have the code for the 2023-2024 season currently on this repo because our team has chosen to keep those programs private until the end of the season in May.
